      m_Summary: What is exposure?
      m_Description: "In HDRP exposure is just one of many Volume Overrides. However
        its so imporant that it deserves a tutorial of its own.\n\nExposure simulates
        how our eyes adapt to lighting conditions in real life. For example being
        able to see slightly better after spending some time in a dark room. \n\nThere
        are a few different exposure modes in HDRP, the most notable are:\n\n<b>Fixed</b>
        - Basically lets you choose a light intensity that your eyes have adapted
        to. Will not change if you enter or leave dark areas. \n\n<b>Automatic</b>
        - Simulates how eyes adapt to light intensities automatically. It has more
        parameters and is slighly harder to get used to, but is recommended because
        it most accurately resembles real life."
